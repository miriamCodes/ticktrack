# ticktrack
'ticktrack' is my first ever solo-project, featuring a promodoro-timer that saves the categories worked on and, in the future, displays them in form of a time-tracker.

After 4 days, I planned out the design using openAPI spec and a sequence diagram, 
I created a color schema, styled all the components and made them responsive,
I built the timer logic in react,
I implemented the back- and frontend logic for the category component
& started the history component.

For the backend I used koa and sequelize with an underlying postgres sql database.
Fot the frontend I used react and MUI (to handle the color schema and styling of buttons and inputs).

As a next step, I plan to complete the history component and display the successfully completed intervals in pie diagrams (by category) and bar diagrams (by day).
Additionally, I want to refactor the code to typescript and write tests.
